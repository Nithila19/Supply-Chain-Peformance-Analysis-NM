# Supply-Chain-Peformance-Analysis-NM

📦 Supply Chain Performance Analysis

This project analyzes supply chain data to evaluate and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) that impact operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall performance. The goal is to provide insights through data visualization and analysis for better decision-making in supply chain management.

🧭 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

Analyze the supply chain dataset to identify trends, bottlenecks, and performance metrics.

Understand the relationship between various KPIs like shipping mode, cost, profit, and region.

Provide interactive and visual insights for business stakeholders to improve supply chain operations.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key attributes:

Order ID

Ship Mode

Customer Segment

Region

Product Category

Sales

Profit

Quantity

Discount

📁 Source: The dataset is embedded in the Jupyter notebook and resembles common public supply chain datasets such as those from Kaggle or Superstore-style data.

🧰 Technologies Used

Tool/Library	Purpose

Python	Programming language

Jupyter Notebook	Interactive data exploration and visualization
